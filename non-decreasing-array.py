# Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

# We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [4,2,3]
# Output: true
# Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [4,2,1]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.

# Example 3:
# Input: [3,4,2,3]
# Output: false
