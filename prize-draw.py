# To participate in a prize draw each one gives his/her firstname.

# Each letter of a firstname has a value which is its rank in the 
# English alphabet. A and a have rank 1, B and b rank 2 and so on.

# The length of the firstname is added to the sum of these ranks 
# hence a number som.

# An array of random weights is linked to the firstnames and each 
# som is multiplied by its corresponding weight to get what they 
# call a winning number.

# Example:
# names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"
# weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]

# PauL -> som = length of firstname + 16 + 1 + 21 + 12 = 4 + 50 -> 54
# The *weight* associated with PauL is 2 so PauL's *winning number* is 54 * 2 = 108.
# Now one can sort the firstnames in decreasing order of the winning numbers. 
# When two people have the same winning number sort them alphabetically 
# by their firstnames.

# Task:
# parameters: st a string of firstnames, we an array of weights, n a rank

# return: the firstname of the participant whose rank is n (ranks are numbered from 1)

# Example:
# names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"
# weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]
# n: 4

# The function should return: "PauL"
# Notes:
# The weight array is at least as long as the number of names, 
# it may be longer.

# If st is empty return "No participants".

# If n is greater than the number of participants then return 
# "Not enough participants".
