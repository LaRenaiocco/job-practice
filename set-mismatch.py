# LEETCODE Day 2
# You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. 
# Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another 
# number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

# You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after 
# the error.

# Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them 
# in the form of an array.
