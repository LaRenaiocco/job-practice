# 1RM calculator
# there are 3 theories for calculating maximum weight 1RM based on 
# weight and repititions.  Which one has the highest weight?
# return integer rounded max weight
# If reps is 1, return weight
# if reps is 0, return 0

# Epley
# 1RM = w(1 + (r/30))
# McGlothin
# 1RM = (100*w)/(101.3-(2.67123*r))
# Lombardi
# 1RM = (w*r)**0.10
