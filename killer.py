# Who is the killer?
# Some people have been killed!
# You have managed to narrow the suspects down to just a few. Luckily, you know every person who those suspects have seen on the day of the murders.

# Task.
# Given a dictionary with all the names of the suspects and everyone that they have seen on that day which may look like this:

# {'James': ['Jacob', 'Bill', 'Lucas'],
#  'Johnny': ['David', 'Kyle', 'Lucas'],
#  'Peter': ['Lucy', 'Kyle']}
# and also a list of the names of the dead people:

# ['Lucas', 'Bill']
# return the name of the one killer, in our case 'James' because he is the only person that saw both 'Lucas' and 'Bill'

#pseudocode
# iterate through the dictionary keys
# for each key
# for each person in killed list
# check if killed is in value array of key
# if yes, return Key
